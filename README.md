The aim of this project is to create a robot capable of detecting an object in terms of whether it is an 
M&M or not and follow up by sorting M&Ms by their color. This concept was created to take the 
place of labor-intensive sorting and provide an efficient approach to be utilized in industries such as 
packaging facilities, processing companies, etc...
